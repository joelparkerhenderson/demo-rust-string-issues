# Demonstration of Rust string issues

Demonstration of Rust string issues,
such as UTF-8 encoding, accents, etc.

Feedback welcome.

This repo is based on the artice about string handling here:

* https://mortoray.com/2013/11/27/the-string-type-is-broken/

This code is tested on Rust 1.5.3:

```sh
$ rustc --version                                                                     
rustc 1.53.0
```

To use this code, download it and run it as usual for Rust:

```sh
cargo run
```

Output:

```sh
Does it print correctly? noÃ«l
What is the character length? 4
What is the reverse? lÃ«on
What are the first three characters? noÃ«
Does it print correctly? ğŸ˜¸ğŸ˜¾
What is the character length? 2
What is the reverse? ğŸ˜¾ğŸ˜¸
What is the substring after the first character? ğŸ˜¾
```
