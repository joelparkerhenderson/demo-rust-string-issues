## Issues


### Decomposed characters

Rust can represent some characters as either "precomposed form" or "decomposed form".

* Precomposed form is one code point. For example "ë" may be represented as one code point U+00EB.

* Decomposed form is multiple code points that combine. For example "ë" may be represented as code points U+0065 U+0308, aka the letter "e" followed by the combining umlaut accent. Decomposed form is aka a "combining sequence" because the diaeresis is combining with the base character.

Many computers render identically for the precomposed form and decomposed form.

* This means a user can't visually see the difference.

* You more or less need a hex editor to figure out which form you've got.

One could reasonably conclude that precomposed forms are just better and easier.

* But precomposed forms are considered legacy: we can't encode every possible combining sequence into a code point, so we might as well go the other way and decompose whenever possible. That's what Normalization Form D is about.

* In the meantime, we can use non-standard-library Rust code in order to deal with precomposed forms and decomposed forms.


### Reverse

Naively reversing a Unicode string can go wrong in several ways. 

* For example, merely reversing the chars (Unicode Scalar Values) in a string can cause combining marks to become attached to the wrong characters. 

* For example, suppose your string uses decomposed form and contains a combining sequence such a diaeresis. Naively reversing your string will tear the combining sequence, then apply the diaeresis to the wrong character.

Grapheme-level reversal may produce unexpected output.

* For example, if the input string contains certain non-printable control codes, such as directional formatting characters, then the output is unexpected.


## Requirements

This code is tested on Rust 1.5.3:

```sh
$ rustc --version                                                                     
rustc 1.53.0
```

To use this code, download it and run it as usual for Rust:

```sh
cargo run
```

Output:
